The Virtual Classroom Manager Programming Exercise will demonstrates six different design patterns
Behavioral Design Patterns:

--->Observer Pattern: Used for notifying students of new assignments.
--->Strategy Pattern: Used for different grading strategies.
Creational Design Patterns:

--->Singleton Pattern: Ensures only one instance of the ClassroomManager.
--->Factory Pattern: Used to create different types of users (students, teachers).
Structural Design Patterns:

--->Adapter Pattern: Adapts a legacy system for new assignment notifications.
--->Decorator Pattern: Adds additional responsibilities to a basic student object.
